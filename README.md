# Cloud Calendar

## By Kim Heidorn
___
This is a functional shared calendar that can be used to keep track of
appointments. Clicking on the individual date tiles pops-up the
day's appointments, which can be edited or deleted from this page. Toggling between
the months is achieved by clicking on the names to the right and left of t
he rendered calendar. On the bottom section of the calendar is a drop down to jump
to specific months or years. The plus sign in the bottom right allows for the addition
of new appointments.

This program was built out using vanilla Javascript. One long term goal is to add
user authentication to enable the calendar for personal use.
